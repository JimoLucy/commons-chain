CHANGES:
========
o CatalogBase - add constructor which takes an already built map of 
  commands, for easier use in dependency-injection environments. 
o Expose catalogFactory so that subclasses can get at it. 
o CHAIN-3: Decouple CatalogFactory lookup from LookupAction.
o ChainResources - factor out the comma-delimited parsing into a 
  separate method, fix the whitespace-skipping bugs in it. 
o Add support for using LookupCommand in a way which does not pass 
  through the result from the looked up command.
