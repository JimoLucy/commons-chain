<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Overview">
<p>
  Commons Chain uses <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> or
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> as a build system.
</p>
</section>
<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Maven Goals">
  <p>
    To build a jar file, change into Chain's root directory and run 
    <strong><code>maven jar</code></strong>.
    The result will be in the "target" subdirectory.
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the Javadocs, run <strong><code>maven javadoc</code></strong>.
    The result will be in "target/docs/apidocs".
  </p>
  <p>
    To build the full website, run <strong><code>maven site</code></strong>.
    The result will be in "target/docs".
  </p>
  <p>
	Further details can be found in the
	<a href="http://commons.apache.org/building.html">commons build instructions</a>.
  </p>
  <subsection name="Changelog Report">
    <p>
      The default configuration for the 
      <a href="http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/plugins/changelog/">Changelog Report</a>
      is to show changes within the last year. If however you wish to see changes since a
      specified date you can override the configuration by adding a <b>build.properties</b>
      file to the Commons Chain directory. For example to show all the changes since the
      Chain 1.0 release, you would have the following in the <b>build.properties</b>:
    </p>
    <p><source><![CDATA[
maven.changelog.type=date
maven.changelog.date=2004-12-09
]]></source></p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, an issue with Subversion imports means that this report will only pick
      up changes since the last import - which in the case of the ASF repository was December 2005.
      If you require the changelog report to show changes prior to December 2005 for Commons Chain
      then you can use the workaround described
      <a href="http://www.niallp.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/ChangelogSubversionIssue.html">here</a>.
    </p>

  <subsection name="Building With JDK 1.3">
    <p>
      Commons Chain can be built using <b>JDK 1.3</b> - however you will need to modify the
      <b>project.xml</b> to add an additional dependency for <b>xml apis</b>:
    </p>
    <p><source><![CDATA[
<dependency>
    <groupId>xml-apis</groupId>
    <artifactId>xml-apis</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.2</version>
    <url>http://xml.apache.org/commons/</url>
</dependency>]]></source></p>
  </subsection>
</section>
<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Ant Goals">
  <p>
    To build a jar file and the javadocs, change into Chain's root directory
    and run <strong><code>ant dist</code></strong>.
    The result will be in the "dist" subdirectory.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================================================== -->
<section name="Nightly Builds">
  <p>
      <a href="http://people.apache.org/builds/commons/nightly/commons-chain/">Nightly Builds</a>
      are built once a day from the current SVN HEAD. These are provided purely for test purposes and are <b>NOT
      official releases</b> of the Apache Software Foundation - Released versions of Commons Chain are
      available <a href="http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_chain.cgi">here</a>.
